# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, providing a basic structure and setup for developing React applications.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload automatically if you make any changes to the source code. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode, allowing you to run and monitor tests as you make changes to your code.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the application for better performance and creates an optimized bundle of your code. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes for cache management. Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This will download and install all the required packages and dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the app in development mode, and you can view it in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Any changes you make to the source code will automatically reload the app.

## Folder Structure

The project structure follows the conventions of Create React App. Here is an overview of the main folders and files:

- `public`: This folder contains the publicly accessible static files, such as HTML, images, and icons.

- `src`: This folder contains the application source code. It is where you will write most of your code.

  - `components`: This folder contains reusable React components used in the application.

  - `styles`: This folder contains CSS or SASS files for styling the application.

  - `App.js`: This is the main component where the application is initialized and other components are rendered.

  - `index.js`: This is the entry point of the application. It renders the `App` component into the root DOM element.

  - `index.css`: This is the main CSS file for the application.

  - `...`: Other files and folders may be present depending on your specific project setup.
